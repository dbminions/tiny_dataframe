## Tiny Dataframe

Inspired by [FrostDB](https://github.com/polarsignals/frostdb)
and [Arrow DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion).

### Why Dataframe

Dataframe removes the complexity of handling `SQL parsing`, `SQL rewriting`, `Binding`, `SQL Query Planner` etc. Once
the dataframe is mature, we can easily integrate it with an SQL engine.
